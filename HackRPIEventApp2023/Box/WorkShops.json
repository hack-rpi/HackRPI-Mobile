There are a wide variety of potential attacks, but learning just a basic few can go a very long way towards improving your coding skills. In this workshop, we will participate in a set of interactive Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges designed to demonstrate some of the ways attackers think. Alongside hacking our machines, we will also learn some secure coding paradigms to protect against these attacks. By the end of the workshop, you will have a newfound appreciation for the importance of secure coding and be armed with the ability to build more secure software."
