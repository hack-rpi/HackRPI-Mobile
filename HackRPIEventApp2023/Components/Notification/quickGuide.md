# Apple Push Notifications Guide

This guide provides a quick overview of how to implement Push notifications on iOS, including steps to create certificates and convert them for use with Python.

## Create an App ID

To implement push notifications, you must have a specific App ID in your profile. If you've only used the wildcard App ID for your tests, you'll need to create a specific App ID for your project.

- **Important**: Use an explicit App ID; wildcard App IDs do not work with APNs.
- **Remember**: Check the Push Notifications option.

## Create the Certificate

Once you have an explicit App ID, you can create a push notification service certificate.

- **Note**: Remember to create both test and production certificates.
- **Keychain Access**: The developer portal provides instructions for requesting a certificate via Keychain Access.

## Export the Certificate

After obtaining the certificate, install it on your Mac and export it in the p12 format from Keychain Access.

- **Export with Private Key**: Ensure you click on the certificate to include its private key in the export.
- **Password**: You can leave the password blank when prompted.

## Convert to PEM Format

Use the following commands to convert your .p12 file into a .pem certificate containing both the certificate and private key:

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out key.pem -in certificate.p12
openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -out certificate.pem -in certificate.p12
cat key.pem certificate.pem > pushcertificates.pem
```
````

- **Remove Password**: If you set a password and wish to remove it, use `openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pem`.

## Get the Device Token

To send a push notification, you need the device's token.

### For iOS 8 and Above

- **Objective-C Example**:

```objc
UIApplication *application = [UIApplication sharedApplication];
if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(isRegisteredForRemoteNotifications)]) {
    [application registerUserNotificationSettings:[UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeSound | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge) categories:nil]];
    [application registerForRemoteNotifications];
}
```

- **Swift Example**:

```swift
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options: [.alert, .sound, .badge]) {
    granted, error in
    if granted {
        print("Permission granted!")
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()
        }
    } else {
        print("error while getting permission \(String(describing: error))")
    }
}
```

### Retrieving the Device Token

- **Objective-C and Swift Examples**: Show how to log the device token upon registration for notifications.

## Send a Push Notification

To send a push notification, you can use the PyAPNs2 library. Download it from GitHub and follow the instructions to use your `pushcertificates.pem` for sending notifications.

- **PyAPNs2 GitHub**: [https://github.com/Pr0Ger/PyAPNs2](https://github.com/Pr0Ger/PyAPNs2)
- **Python Example**: Includes how to create a payload and send a notification using the `APNsClient`.

## Get the Notification in Your App

It's important to handle the notification in your app properly, including setting the badge number and processing the notification data.

- **Clear the Badge**: How to set the application icon badge number to 0.
- **Process Notification**: Implement `didReceiveRemoteNotification` in your app delegate to handle incoming notifications.

## Use Authentication Keys

An alternative to certificates is using authentication keys, which can simplify the process and is supported by utilities like PushNotifications from GitHub.

- **PushNotifications GitHub**: [https://github.com/onmyway133/PushNotifications](https://github.com/onmyway133/PushNotifications)

This guide aims to simplify the process of setting up Apple Push Notifications and includes examples in both Objective-C and Swift. For more detailed information on payloads, refer to the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/generating_a_remote_notification?language=objc).

Happy coding!

## Advanced Considerations

### Content-Available Notifications

- Use the `content-available` flag for notifications that require the app to perform a background update. This is particularly useful for news apps or applications that need to fetch the latest content in response to a push notification.

### Rich Notifications

- iOS 10 and above support rich notifications, which allow you to include media attachments and more interactive elements in your notifications. To leverage this, use the `mutable-content` flag and handle the notification in the service extension.

### Priority of Notifications

- You can set the priority of your push notifications to `10` (high) or `5` (normal). High priority should be used for urgent notifications, such as calls or messages, whereas normal priority can be used for content updates.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Notification Not Delivered

- **Check Device Token**: Ensure the device token used is correct and matches the device you are trying to send the notification to.
- **Check APNs Environment**: Make sure you're sending the notification to the correct environment (development or production), matching your appâ€™s build.
- **Validate Certificate**: Verify that the certificate used for sending notifications has not expired and matches the environment you are targeting.

### Notification Delivered but Not Showing

- **Check Notification Settings**: Ensure the notification settings in both the iOS settings and the app are configured to allow notifications.
- **Inspect Payload**: Make sure the notification payload is correct and includes the necessary alert body or sound.
- **Background Notifications**: If using `content-available` notifications, ensure the app is set up correctly to handle background updates.

## Monitoring and Analytics

Consider integrating a third-party service or using Apple's Push Notification service logs to monitor the delivery and interaction rates of your notifications. This can provide valuable insights into how users engage with your notifications and highlight areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

Implementing push notifications in your iOS app can significantly enhance user engagement and keep your app users informed. By following the guidelines outlined in this guide and considering the advanced considerations and troubleshooting tips, you can ensure a smooth implementation and delivery process. Always test your notification system thoroughly and stay updated with Apple's latest APNs documentation and best practices.

android install and develop

## Preparation

Before starting, ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Method 1: Using EAS Build

EAS (Expo Application Services) CLI is a command-line tool to interact with the Expo services. This method is preferable if you are using simulators for iOS or Android.

#### Step 1: Install EAS CLI

Run the following command to install EAS CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

#### Step 2: Log in to Your Expo Account

```bash
eas login
```

Follow the prompts to enter your Expo credentials. If you don't have an Expo account, you'll need to create one at [Expo's official site](https://expo.dev/signup).

#### Step 3: Configure the Project

Initialize the build configuration:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

#### Step 4: Build the Project

You can build for both platforms simultaneously or separately:

```bash
eas build --platform all
```

Or, to build for a specific platform:

- For Android:

  ```bash
  eas build --platform android
  ```

- For iOS:

  ```bash
  eas build --platform ios
  ```

To monitor the build process, use:

```bash
eas build:list
```

### Method 2: Using expo-notifications Library

This method is suited for physical devices. Ensure your device is connected to your development machine.

#### Step 1: Install Required Libraries

```bash
npx expo install expo-notifications expo-device expo-constants
```

#### Step 2: Setup for Android

Modify the `google-services.json` file to connect to your Google account and set up your FCM server credentials:

- Follow the instructions [here to add Android FCM V1 credentials](https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/fcm-credentials).

#### Step 3: Setup for iOS

You need an active Apple Developer account to proceed:

```bash
eas build
```

### Testing Push Notifications

Start your Expo project:

```bash
expo start
```

Follow the testing instructions detailed in the comments within the `handleClick` function in `CalendarObject.js`.

### Additional Setup: Android Studio

If you need to install and configure Android Studio for development, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install:**

   - Go to the [Android Studio download page](https://developer.android.com/studio) and download the installer for your operating system.
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Android Studio.

2. **Configure Android Studio:**

   - Open Android Studio.
   - Go through the 'Android Studio Setup Wizard'. This includes downloading Android SDK components that are required for development.

3. **Create a Virtual Device:**
   - In Android Studio, open the AVD Manager by navigating to `Tools > AVD Manager`.
   - Click on "Create Virtual Device", select your preferred device definition, and then select a system image (e.g., a recent Android OS version).
   - Follow the prompts to create the virtual device.

By completing these setups, you can start developing and testing applications using Expo's notification capabilities on your local machine.

## **Handling Notifications in iOS**

Once your app is set up to receive notifications, you need to ensure they are handled correctly:

- **Set the Badge Number**: Typically, you might want to clear the notification badge once a notification is read:
  ```objc
  application.applicationIconBadgeNumber = 0;
  ```
- **Process Incoming Notifications**: Use the `didReceiveRemoteNotification:` method to manage the data received in notifications:
  ```swift
  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable : Any]) {
      // Handle the notification data
      print("Received notification: \(userInfo)")
  }
  ```

## **Advanced Notification Features**

Enhance the functionality of your notifications with these advanced features:

### **Content-Available Notifications**

Ideal for applications that require fresh data even when in the background. Useful for news apps or any service that needs timely updates.

### **Rich Notifications**

Include media attachments for a more engaging experience. Use the `mutable-content` flag and modify the notification in a service extension.

### **Notification Priority**

Set the priority to high for urgent notifications. Lower priority can be used for less critical updates to conserve battery on user devices.
