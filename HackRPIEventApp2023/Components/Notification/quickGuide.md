# Apple Push Notifications Guide

This guide provides a quick overview of how to implement Push notifications on iOS, including steps to create certificates and convert them for use with Python.

## Create an App ID

To implement push notifications, you must have a specific App ID in your profile. If you've only used the wildcard App ID for your tests, you'll need to create a specific App ID for your project.

- **Important**: Use an explicit App ID; wildcard App IDs do not work with APNs.
- **Remember**: Check the Push Notifications option.

## Create the Certificate

Once you have an explicit App ID, you can create a push notification service certificate.

- **Note**: Remember to create both test and production certificates.
- **Keychain Access**: The developer portal provides instructions for requesting a certificate via Keychain Access.

## Export the Certificate

After obtaining the certificate, install it on your Mac and export it in the p12 format from Keychain Access.

- **Export with Private Key**: Ensure you click on the certificate to include its private key in the export.
- **Password**: You can leave the password blank when prompted.

## Convert to PEM Format

Use the following commands to convert your .p12 file into a .pem certificate containing both the certificate and private key:

```shell
openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out key.pem -in certificate.p12
openssl pkcs12 -clcerts -nokeys -out certificate.pem -in certificate.p12
cat key.pem certificate.pem > pushcertificates.pem
```
````

- **Remove Password**: If you set a password and wish to remove it, use `openssl rsa -in key.pem -out key.pem`.

## Get the Device Token

To send a push notification, you need the device's token.
