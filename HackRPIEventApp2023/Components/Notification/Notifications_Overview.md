# Notifications Overview

Notifications are an essential aspect of mobile and web applications, offering a way to convey important information to users, whether the app is running on the device or not. For instance, sports apps can notify users of their favorite team's scores. Notifications can also prompt apps to download data and update their interfaces, displaying alerts, playing sounds, or marking the app's icon.

## Display
Notifications appear on iOS devices' lock and home screens. They can be generated locally within an app or remotely from a managed server. Local notifications are set based on specific conditions like time or location. Remote notifications are generated by a server and sent through the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs), which handles their delivery.

## Framework Capabilities
The framework for managing notifications allows applications to:
- Define supported notification types.
- Schedule local notifications.
- Handle and respond to incoming notifications.
- Define custom actions associated with notification types.

Although the system strives to deliver notifications promptly, immediate delivery cannot be guaranteed. The PushKit framework provides a more timely delivery mechanism for specific notification types, such as VoIP or watchOS features.

For web applications, especially on Safari version 16.0 and higher, remote notifications can be generated using Push API code, working across Safari and other browsers, managed by a server.

## Integration with Siri
Siri can use the information from your app's notifications to make suggestions to users in Search, News, Safari, and other apps. Users can manage this feature through Siri and search settings.

## Design Guidelines
For notification design, it's recommended to follow the Human Interface Guidelines to ensure they are user-friendly and effective.

## Topics
### Notification Management
- Central objects and delegates like `UNUserNotificationCenter` manage notification-related activities and responses.

### Remote Notifications
- Setting up a remote notification server and registering your app with APNs to send notifications.

### Notification Requests
- Creating delivery requests for local notifications and accessing delivered notification content.

### Safari Push Notifications
- Sending web push notifications for web apps and browsers, including Safari.

### Notification Content
- Modifying and inspecting notification payloads.

### Triggers
- Setting conditions for notification delivery, including time, location, and remote triggers.

### Notification Categories and User Actions
- Defining custom actions and categories for notifications to enhance user interactions.

This summary covers the extensive capabilities and considerations for implementing notifications in applications, addressing both local and remote notifications, user interactions, and integration with system services like Siri and APNs.
