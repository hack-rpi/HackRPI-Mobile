Not sure entirely what went wrong here; This page was working earlier in the semester,
but a later commit seems to have broken it. I first was looking into fixing the mentor queue,
because all the elements within the page where so smushed together that I couldn't even 
tell what page it was and just accepted the text at the top, but after some exploration
i realized that changes to the mentor queue elements didn't change the page, not matter
how extreme. After looking back into the QueEntry page, I assumed something had
gone wrong with the containers, and spent time messing with different orders of
containers wrapping around each other, but it seemed to all be in order. Eventually
I found the issue was fixed by just making the main container larger, and slightly shifting
things around with padding till it looked normal again. I'm really not sure how this could have
broken in this manner naturally, but it should work now.
